# Membership 2 - Stripe Checkout Gateway

[Stripe Checkout 2.0](https://stripe.com/en-ca/payments/checkout) gateway for Membership Pro by [WPMU DEV](https://wpmudev.org)

> **⚠️ Warning!** Not stable yet. Do not recommend using this on a production environment.

### Important 💰

There are few limitations because this plugin is currently in beta. But I will try to get them working when I get some free time.

* Coupons are not yet supported as the Stripe Checkout API is not directly supporting it.
* Existing subscriptions can not be migrated to Stripe checkout as of now.

### Requirements
* [Membership 2](https://github.com/wpmudev/membership-2)
* PHP >= 5.6.0
* WordPress >= 4.0
* [Stripe Library Requirements](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php)
